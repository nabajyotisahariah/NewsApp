TypeError: 0, _$$_REQUIRE(_dependencyMap[5], "react/jsx-runtime" createBottomTabNavigator

 I'm having the same problem when trying to upgrade react-navigation from 5.x to 6.x, the problem originating in the @react-navigation/elements package.

I solved this problem as follows:

yarn add react-native-screens

ViewPropTypes will be removed from React Native. Migrate to ViewPropTypes exported 
from 'deprecated-react-native-prop-types


Temporary solution.
ignoreWarnings.js

import { LogBox } from "react-native";

if (__DEV__) {
  const ignoreWarns = [
    "EventEmitter.removeListener",
    "[fuego-swr-keys-from-collection-path]",
    "Setting a timer for a long period of time",
    "ViewPropTypes will be removed from React Native",
    "AsyncStorage has been extracted from react-native",
    "exported from 'deprecated-react-native-prop-types'.",
    "Non-serializable values were found in the navigation state.",
    "VirtualizedLists should never be nested inside plain ScrollViews",
  ];

  const warn = console.warn;
  console.warn = (...arg) => {
    for (const warning of ignoreWarns) {
      if (arg[0].startsWith(warning)) {
        return;
      }
    }
    warn(...arg);
  };

  LogBox.ignoreLogs(ignoreWarns);
}
App.js

// import at the very top of everything.
import "../ignoreWarnings";
