React Native provides an in-app developer menu which offers several debugging options. You can access the Dev Menu by shaking your device or via keyboard shortcuts:

iOS Simulator: Cmd ⌘ + D (or Device > Shake)
Android emulators: Cmd ⌘ + M (macOS) or Ctrl + M (Windows and Linux)


To debug JavaScript code in Chrome, select "Open Debugger" from the Dev Menu. This will open a new tab at http://localhost:8081/debugger-ui.
